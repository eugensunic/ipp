  info_content1: `Long-term maintenance therapy with proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) was shown to be
  associated with an increased risk for esophageal cancer, even in patients taking PPIs for indications not previously associated with this cancer risk,
  according to results from a new study from Sweden. The authors call for "a more restrictive attitude towards maintenance use of PPIs.`,

  stats1: `
     <p> - 796,492 patients without a history of cancer who were exposed to maintenance PPI therapy between 2005 and 201 </p>
     <p> - female (58.5%), 34.0% were >= 70 years </p>
     <p> - indications for PPI use included maintenance therapy with Aspirin (34.8%),  (NSAIDs) (30.4%), (GERD) (25.3%), gastroduodenitis (13.2%), and peptic ulcer (10.0%)</p>
     <p> - 800,000 PPI users were compared to general population (matched in sex, age over the same period of time)</p>
     <p> - (SIR) for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in PPI users was 3.93, and the overall SIR for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was 2.77</p>
     <p> - patients without GERD taking PPI maintenance therapy with NSAIDs or aspirin, the SIR for EAC was 2.74 and 2.06, respectively</p>`,

  problem1: `<p>"These findings are surprising because of the lack of evidence that goes with this observation. The allegation of harm should always start with a hypothesis as to why a reported association may be causal.
   None is suggested in this report," Johnson told Medscape Medical News.</p>
  <p>Jeffrey Meyerhardt, MD, a medical oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, agreed.
   Even though the study authors "made efforts to try and tease this up, the strongest associations were still observed in patients taking PPIs for acid reflux, which could be an early sign of esophageal cancer."</p>
  <p>"I would not let one cohort study change my practice," Gabbard told Medscape Medical News. "This study demonstrates an association, not a cause and effect. I would be very careful not to state that PPIs cause esophageal cancer based on these data."</p>`,

  conclusion1: `<p>The long term use of PPIs is associated with increased risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma in the absence of other risk factors. Long term use of PPIs should be addressed with caution.</p>`,

  info_content2: ` Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is associated with worsening of gastric atrophy, particularly in Helicobacter pylori (HP)-infected subjects. We determined the association between PPIs use and gastric cancer (GC) among HP-infected subjects who had received HP therapy.`,

  stats2: `
     <p> - among 63 397 eligible subjects, 153 (0.24%) developed gastric cancer during a median follow-up of 7.6 years </p>
     <p> - PPIs use was associated with an increased GC risk (HR 2.44, 95% CI 1.42 to 4.20), while H2RA was not (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.07) </p>
     <p> - risk increased with duration of PPIs use (HR 5.04, 95% CI 1.23 to 20.61; 6.65, 95% CI 1.62 to 27.26 and 8.34, 95% CI 2.02 to 34.41 for ≥1 year, ≥2 years and ≥3 years, respectively)</p>
     <p> - The adjusted absolute risk difference for PPIs VS non-PPIs use was 4.29 excess GC (95% CI 1.25 to 9.54) per 10 000 person-years</p>`,

  problem2: `<p>The new results also conflict with a recently published, US Food and Drug Administration–mandated follow-up study conducted with pantoprazole, said David A. Johnson, MD, chief of gastroenterology
  at Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk (Aliment Pharmacol Ther. 2016;43:73-82).</p>
<p>"No increased risk [for gastric cancer] was observed with prolonged PPI exposure," he said.</p>
<p>Dr Johnson, who was asked for comment, also stated that the study has a "geographic bias" because it is from Hong Kong and "specific risks for gastric cancer are well recognized in Asian patients."</p>
<p>In terms of study weaknesses, the researchers  lacked information on some risk factors, such as diet, family history, and socioeconomic status.  And despite the large sample of more than 63,000 H pylori–infected patients,
 the small number of gastric cancer cases did not allow for any "meaningful evaluation of the dosage effect and role of different PPIs," the researchers say. </p>
 <p>Dr Johnson said there was another study weakness: "Important" demographic variables that are risk factors for gastric cancer — such as  smoking, alcohol use, obesity, diet, and family history — are not accounted for.
He also made a general observation about PPI-related research: "Most studies showed that any potential effects of PPIs tend to disappear with time and that the most likely explanation for the effects is confounding by indication rather than causality."</p>`,

  conclusion2: `<p>Long-term use of PPIs was still associated with an increased GC risk in subjects even after HP eradication therapy.</p>`,

  Although the results provide reassuring data from a large prospective study, they are unlikely to completely resolve safety concerns about long-term use of PPIs.
