          <p>Forum/discussion posts were extracted (by myself) when a patient talked about what his doctor told him about PPIs.
            In other words, if a patient complained or just wrote his comment on the Internet about his doctor opinion on this
          drugs, the doctorâ€™s comment was pulled out and saved into a database.</p>

          <p>There are a lot of comments from patients on the Internet who express their doctors (MD, specialist)
          thoughts and therefore share them with other discussion participants. This information was used in order to represent the statistics of Dr. opinions.</p>
