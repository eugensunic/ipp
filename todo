IF THE CSS BREAKS THAT'S BECAUSE OF EXTRA FORWARD SLASH APPEARING but not only that
YOU SHOULD MAYBE DELETE HEADER ACCES ORIGIN IN PHP

RELEASE COMMENTS
-----------------
- remove localhost get request, show on console.log();
- see if you need to remove the background a little bit;
- redux logger on console remove,
- delete database
- post-collector typehead in border does not resize on mobile devices


  IMPORTANT
  ---------
  react dynamic routing: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47245999/how-to-achieve-dynamic-routing-in-react-router-4
  - test everything before proceeding to final page


  TODO
  ----
   2. document.body.style.pointerEvents='none' immediately after click
   4. notify if no internet connection on final green submit

  REFACTORING
  -----------

  - refactor on bar functions and async functions, see comments
  - ES6 everything what you can, functions, this, use lexical scope, get rid of returns, spaces between curly brackets, spaces, don't use
  beautify from abramov and fiddle js react...,
  - binding up not in middle of code but in constructor ES 6, abandon bind completely
  - var===false to !var, var===true to var

  DATABASE
  --------

  - last data is 1207 in post id, data id, everything below that is fixed as from 31.12.2017.


  NOTES
  -----
   - write params for testing in this way: url?param_0=0&param_1=20
   - always delete branch when you finished with it (when merged to master)
   - in post php data (not the main one, all the other ones) put order by asc and put distinct id, because sometimes you get doubles and
   - things get messed up when associating on frontend.

  brand-nexium data, post, rest all id's match perfectly
