  DATABASE
  --------

  DONE
  ----
   - maybe adjust css to be nicer for post-div
   - integrate html page to app
   - put images which are not there now
   - css again the post doctor and pharmacy text
   - Add routing
   - http get with params and introduce params on backend php
   - create quick database for upcoming data, abandon big database
   - Make mapping on frontend values to true false false arrays and then send to database!
   - Add percentage sign to stats next to percentage (don't want that)
   - Adjust GERD header when criteria selected (style it)
   - introduce change themes (fonts, background, font color) localStorage, introduce themes make them on index.html so they are global
   - Reactive select on input-page does not go away when clicking outside the dropdown,
   - Fix inputs, allow no char other than numbers

  NOTES
  -----
   - write params for testing in this way: url?param_0=0&param_1=20
   - always delete branch when you finished with it (when merged to master)
   - in post php data (not the main one, all the other ones) put order by asc and put distinct id, because sometimes you get doubles and
   - things get messed up when associating on frontend.

  brand-nexium data, post, rest all id's match perfectly
